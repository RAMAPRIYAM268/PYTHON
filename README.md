Titanic Survival Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using Python to explore passenger demographics, visualize key trends, and predict survival chances. It demonstrates skills in data cleaning, EDA, and basic machine learning.

Key Objectives

Explore relationships between survival and features like age, gender, and class.
Visualize insights using charts and graphs.
Build a simple predictive model to estimate survival chances.

Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas and numpy.
Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.
Machine learning model using logistic regression (scikit-learn).
Achieved around 78% accuracy on test data.

Tools & Libraries

Python 3
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Key Insights
Women and children had higher survival rates.
First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to third-class.
Age and family size influenced survival chances.
